# Securify
A simple python program developed to mimic a smart doorbell.

This project was made to mimic a smart doorbell software on a small scale. It uses face & speech recognition tied with Google Text-to-Speech.

## How it works

When the program is run:
1. The program initiates the camera and takes a picture of the user.
2. The user speaks into the microphone identifying who he is and is also m ade to enter a pin.
3. The program then compares the photo, the name and the pin to a user already present in the database.
4. When everything matches, the user is verified and let in and the program closes.
	* In case, the user is not verified, then the program sends an email to the concerned person with the photo of the person trying to get in.
