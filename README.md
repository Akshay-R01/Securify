# Securify
A simple python program developed to mimic a smart doorbell.

This project was made to mimic a smart doorbell software on a small scale. It uses face & speech recognition tied with Google Text-to-Speech.

## How it works

When the program is started :
1. The program initiates the camera and takes a picture of the user.
2. The user speaks into the microphone identifying who he is and is also made to enter a PIN.
3. The program then compares the photo, the name and the PIN to a user already present in previously made database.
4. When everything matches, the user is verified and let in and and email is sent to the concerned person just mentioning the name of the person entering.
	* In case the user is not verified, the program sends an email attached with the photo of the person trying to get in.
